# First subject: libft

Our first subject is creating an own static library in the programming language C, containing a makefile for creating it. The majority of functions inside the static library are implementations of basic functions (e.g. strlen from the header string.h).

## Usage

In the upcomming projects we are allowed to use our own library.
